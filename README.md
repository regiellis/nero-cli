## Why

I have serveral machines local and remote that I have InvokeAI installed on. I wanted a simple way to update/downgrade them without having to manually
download the release from github and install it on each machine. This tool allows me to do that. It also made sense to use the offical InvokeAI installer
instead roll a patch work that may not work as expected.
